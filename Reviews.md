Reviewer #1: 
Authors investigated the application of computer vision and machine learning methods in Fractography
as a tool for automatic failure analysis process and thus minimize the human-induced bias. 
The complex interaction between intrinsic (e.g. microstructure) and extrinsic (e.g. environment, loading history) factors cause failures. 
Deep learning (DL) models are efficient in learning complex relationships in feature present in input data. Authors leveraged DL for discovering correlations 
and information encoded in complex geometries of fracture surfaces which are otherwise not visible. Authors used an unsupervised learning pipeline to classify 
fracture surfaces of five tungsten heavy alloys categorized according to Tungsten percentage in them. Further, they analyzed these features on the fracture in 
relation to decision process. The fractographic interpretation of such features shows the extent of plasticity on the fracture surface as tool for classification.
    
Review #2: 
In the study, the unsupervised machine learning pipeline for fractography in WHA have been studied. In this regard, two algorithms have been presented and the minimally
supervised pipelines have been added to classify the clustered data points, which successfully moved on and analyzed some fracture surfaces in alloys
(e. g. Tungsten heavy alloys with different Tungsten contents). Although the research fills the gap in the literature regarding on machine learning algorithm directed at
clustering fracture surfaces, the article lacks adequate discussion on the results.
In addition, some imprecision in the results were found. Some major comments are listed below:
1.      In Figure 1 and the following figure 12, all the SEM fracture images from WHA samples lack of scale bar, which may bring imprecision since the size and 
2.      morphology of dimples are essential characters for fracture research in alloys.
3.      In the manuscript, the benchmark, especially the data recognition, for evaluating and classifying the images for fracture need better interpretation.
4.      The authors proposed two question in the manuscript. And the second one is the new correlations between the fracture surface roughness and the fracture toughness.
5.       What is correlations in this work?
