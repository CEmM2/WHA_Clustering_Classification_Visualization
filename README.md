# Clustering and Classification Unsupervised ML algorithms - Visualization of Activation Maps

The main objective of this repository is to present Unsupervised ML data pipelines that enable the clustering and the classification of SEM fracture images, obtained after scanning the fracture surfaces of WHA samples with different tungsten composition. Additionally, aiming to interpret the functionality of these algorithms and acquire better understanding of the internal operations that enable the efficacy of the algorithms, another algorithm that visualizes the activation maps of the last convolution layer, according to their importance on the data pipelines, is developed.
